				 <h1>SIDDHIVINAYAK MANDIR</h1>
				 Consecrated on 19 November 1801, the original structure of the Siddhivinayak Temple was
				 a small 3.6 m x 3.6 m square brick structure with a dome-shaped brick sikhara. The temple
				 was built by the contractor Laxman Vithu Patil. The building was funded by a rich Agri woman 
				 named Deubai Patil. Childless, Deaubai built the temple so that the Lord should grant children
				 to other barren women. Ramakrishna Jambhekar Maharaj, a disciple of the Hindu saint Akkalkot
				 Swami Samarth, buried two divine idols in the front of the presiding deity of the temple on the 
				 orders on his guru. As prophesied by Swami Samarth, after 21 years after the burial of the icons,
			 a mandar tree grew at that spot with a svayambhu Ganesha in its branches
