<h1 align="center">The Gateway of India</h1>
 <h4>is a monument built during the British Raj in Mumbai (formerly Bombay)
 a.[2] It is located on the waterfront in the Apollo Bunder area, South 
 Mumbai and overlooks the Arabian Sea.[3][4] The structure is a basalt arch,
 tres (85 feet) high. It lies at the end of Chhatrapati Shivaji Marg at the 
 water's edge in the harbour of Bombay.[5] It was a crude jetty used by the 
 g community which was later renovated and used as a landing place for 
 British governors and other prominent people. In earlier times, it would 
 have been the first structure that visitors arriving by boat in Mumbai
 would have seen.[6][7] The Gateway has also been referred to as the Taj 
 Mahal of Mumbai,[8] and is the city's top tourist attraction.[9] The 
 structure was erected to commemorate the landing of their Majesties King 
 George V and Queen Mary at Apollo Bunder, when they visited India in 1911
 . Built in Indo-Saracenic style, the foundation stone for the Gateway of 
 India was laid on 31 March 1911. The final design of George Wittet was
 sanctioned in 1914 and the construction of the monument was completed in 
 1924. The Gateway was later the ceremonial entrance to India for Viceroys and the 
 new Governors of Bombay.[10] It served to allow entry and access to India
 .[11] The monument has faced three terror attacks from the beginning of 
 the 21st century; twice in 2003 and it was also the disembarkation point in 2008 when four
 the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to Mumbai, prior to the Delhi Durbar, in December
 1911. However, they only got to see only a cardboard model of the structure since the construction
 did not begin till 1915.[12] The foundation stone was laid on 31 March 1911, by the governor of Bombay 
 Sir George Sydenham Clarke, with the final design of George Wittet sanctioned on 31 March 1913. The gateway was 
 built from yellow basalt and concrete.[13] Between 1915 and 1919, work proceeded on reclamation's at Apollo Bundar 
 (Port) for the land on which the gateway and the new sea wall would be built. The foundations were completed in 1920,
 and construction was finished in 1924.[14] The gateway was opened on 4 December 1924, by the viceroy, the Earl of Reading.
 [6] The last British troops to leave India following the country's independence, the first Battalion of the Somerset Light Infantry, 
 passed through the gateway on their way out in a ceremony on 28 February 1948, signalling the end of its rule.</h4>
