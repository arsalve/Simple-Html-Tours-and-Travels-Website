				 <h1>TAJ HOTEL</h1>
				 he Taj Mahal Hotel was commissioned in Indo-Saracenic style by Tata and first opened its doors to guests on 16 December 1903.
                 It is widely believed that Jamsedji Tata decided to build the hotel after he was refused entry to one of the city's grand hotels
				 of the time, Watson's Hotel, as it was restricted to "whites only". However, this story has been challenged by some commentators
				 that suggest that Tata was unlikely to have been concerned with 'revenge' against his British adversaries. Instead they suggest 
				 that the Taj was built at the urging of editor of The Times of India who felt a hotel "worthy of Bombay" was needed.[1]
                 The original Indian architects were Sitaram Khanderao Vaidya and D. N. Mirza, and the project was completed by an English engineer,
				 W. A. Chambers. The builder was Khansaheb Sorabji Ruttonji Contractor who also designed and built its famous central floating staircase.
				 The cost of construction was £250,000 (£127 million today).[2] During World War I, the hotel was converted into a 600-bed hospital.
				 The dome of the hotel is made from steel as used in the Eiffel Tower. Jamsedji Tata imported the same steel during that time. 
				 The hotel was the first in India to install and operate a steam elevator. The hotel imported American fans, German elevators, Turkish
				 baths and English butlers, for the first time in India.
